# hexo-asset

Support original markdown image expressions when **enabling `post_asset_folder`**,
 and no need to use private hexo tags anymore


## Detail

`./path/asset.jpg` and `path/asset.jpg` will be replaced to `your_post_path/asset.jpg`

URLs started with `http`, `https`, `//`, `/` or plain string(`path/asset.jpg`) will keep


## TODO

* test
* can add a custom host prefix path such as a cdn address
